/*The real-world example of interfaces is that we have multiple classes for different levels of employees working in a particular company and the necessary 
property of the class is the salary of the employees and this. We must be implemented in every class and. Also, it is different for every employee here. 
The concept of the interface is used. We simply create an interface containing an abstract salary method and implement it in all the classes and we can 
easily define different salaries of the employees.
